If water treatment is conducted on-site, the water should be tested for residual chlorine at the point of use to ensure levels between 0.2â€“0.5 mg/L [1]. Additionally, wastewater should be connected to an appropriate sewage system [1].\n\n**Related follow-up questions:**\n\n* What specific health concerns or symptoms do you have?\n* Have you consulted with a healthcare professional about your health concerns?\n* Would you like to ask any other health-related questions?\n\n**References:**\n['**Infectious Diarrhoea summary** by WHO - [Source](https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/ipc---wash/who_whe_infectious_diarrhoea_summary-(3)-(1).pdf?sfvrsn=68b25696_1&download=true)']",
